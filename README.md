                                                                             PROJECT REPORT 



~INTRODUCTION:-

Our a project regarding intergrating different type of basic games using the cpp language and creating a menu based user freindly enviorment for entertainment.
These are games that we have implemented in our source code:-
 1.tick tac toe
 2.avengers secret wars 
 3.snake water gun
 4.truth and dare 
 5.guess the numbers
 6.kbc
(taking into consideration that we can add more games to our code just by intergrating their source code with the main code without any prodigous changes)
The soul concept of working on a project mentioned to create a menu based user input driven program which can be used for entertainment propose 

our project uses the following programming concept
1.OOP(OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING)
2.CPP Language
3.File handling(for keepping track record of a players activity)
4.Basic knowledge of problem solving

For the user who wants to user our project does not requires any pre requistic knowledge a person with almost no coding background can go for it and enjoy gaming
(For black box testing- A person knowing the above mentioned concepts can easily understand our code in background)

~DESCRIPTION OF THE GAMES:-

1.SNAKE WATER GUN:
 Snake water gun is a classic game which is a single player stuff the user can select their choice amoung snake water and gun after the selction of the user the computer will also select from the same
 the code is so designed that the choice of the computer will be random each time without any biasing.
 The source code of the game consist of simple cpp language and addtional package <time.h> for genration of random numbers.

 The following flow of control will be used to for making the decision of the winner

                                                                        SNAKE----->WATER
																		WATER----->GUN
																		GUN------->SNAKE
																		
 The following sorce code has been eqquiped with user freindly interface so the players can enjoy the game without any difficulty.
 Our code is also desinged to keep track of the players who had tried the game before these stats include
 1.No of vistis
 2.No of wins
 3.Win Percentage

 Following data were maneged by classical file handling and OOPs used in cpp.

2.AVENGERS SECRET WARS:-

 Avengers Secret Wars is a basic PVP game which comprises of two players making a team of 3 characters each and pitting it against each other
 in a battle. Each player is given 10 elixir to buy those characters, the costlier the character, the stronger it is.
 The game features a type matchup battle system, the three types being Attack "A", Blast "B" and Speed "S". A<B<S<A (lost the oppurtunity to
 implement cyclic graphs). The team with the last surviving member is declared to be victorious.

 The wins and win percentage of each player is thus recorded, adding a subtle element of engagement to the game. Several ASCII art specimens
 are being employed in order to enhance the visual aspect of the game while not effacing away the charm of text based games.

 Concepts involved:
 1.Basic C++ problem solving
 2.OOPS
 3.File Handling
 4.Series Interpolation and layered rng

 Features of the project:
 1.Extensible list of characters to choose from
 2.Immersive art
 3.Realistic stats
 4.File recording

6.TRUTH AND DARE:-
 A classic game which have been much popular amoung the teenagers generally played with friends the soul concpet of making this game is fun.
 The program of the game will ask the following things from the user name,number of player and what did a player choose truth or dare according to the choice of the player the computer will autoamtically select a ramdon truth or dare 
 The player has to answer the question appered on the screen and then the cycle continues.

 The following sorce code has been eqquiped with user freindly interface so the players can enjoy the game without any difficulty.
 Our code is also desinged to keep track of the players who had tried the game before these stats include
 1.Most Active Players
 2.Name of Players
 3.Total no of Visists

 Our games don't have any restriction regarding the no of players playing and hence you can enjoy our game with a large group or a small group.



~SCOPE OF IMPROVEMENT:-
 1.Our project is desinged in a special way that we can include new games anything we want just by adding there code in form of header files.

 2.UI can be better or we can user graphical user interface to present the games this will probably a domain on which we will work further.

 There are always scope of improvement in any project so we do welcome all the suggestions from the users :)

~CONCUSION:-
 "Gamee" is a quintessential assortment of six simple text based games, employing the usage of C++ language.
 The modest project christened as the "Gamee" is a collective endeavour of a team of four first year undergraduates,
 brandishing no prior project and humble grounding in the domain of computer science.

 Conceding the fact that none of the participants is an aficianado, this program is best to be percieved as the maiden 
 attempt of the team and henceforth is a subject to highly unconventional coding practices. Constructive criticism is 
 highly welcomed.

 The team hopes that our efforts would live up to the prospects of the clientelle and whomsover is concerned and hereby
 presents its unostentatious creation, devised de capo.
